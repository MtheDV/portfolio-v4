        Front-end creative web developer and designer. Currently attending the
        University of British Columbia pursuing a Bachelors in Computer
        Science. Located in the beautiful Okanagan, Canada.

        Although I’m constantly learning as a student, I’ve developed skills
        through self-directed projects and collaborated university projects
        using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React.js, Node.js, Express.js,
        SCSS/SASS, GSAP, SQL, noSQL. This current website has allowed me to
        learn and experience Next.js and the advantages that it provides. An
        ongoing project of redesigning and reorganizing a university team
        formation tool allowed me to grow in Django, Python, and Web
        Development, while exploring the MVC software design pattern. I&apos;ve
        also gained skills in Java through small university projects and game
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve developed my design skills using the Affinity Toolset (Photo,
        Designer, and Publisher) and Figma alongside minimal use of the Adobe
        Toolset (Photoshop and Illustrator). Co-leading a university design
        club has allowed me to become vulnerable and grow while sharing my
        ideas with others.
